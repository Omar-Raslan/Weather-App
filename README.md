# Weather-Journal App Project
This is my second app :
Anatomy :
server.js
website:> app.js + index.html 
#The resources which i used:->
1-https://dev.to/pratham82/using-fetch-api-in-node-js-with-weather-api-3a7d
it's introduce an app with node and fetch weather app:so i benfit from it in promises and fetch way.
2-https://bithacker.dev/fetch-weather-openweathermap-api-javascript
it's aware me about temperature units
3-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSAp5zXWESI&list=PLtFbQRDJ11kF2PJwHI7tGgugIa7poDXYd
this arabic list made a weather app with react and fetch: it's illuminated me the way to compelete this app:
the best about it , that:->used countery and city name instead of zip code=so it's more logic and easy for me.
4- udacity:->may be the server of animal app didn't have change here.
5-https://informationngr.com/us-zip-codes-list/ it's list of us valid zip code wich work in this app.
Notes:-->
1-with zip code i search hard to add countery code {api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip={zip code},{country code}&appid={API key}
}
so i can get egypt :-> but i can't do it :so i'll be thankful to u if u give me the list of countery code :-> i try EG ,or +20 =and it didn't work.
2-in review i ask if it allowed to use react with node ,till now i don't know how to tie them together but i feel curious to do that.
3-defer which u recommended me in review have relationship with async-await:i falled overthinking with it.
finally thanks for all thing.
